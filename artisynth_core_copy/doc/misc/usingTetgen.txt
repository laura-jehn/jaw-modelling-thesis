First download tegen from here

http://tetgen.berlios.de/

Next compile it simply by calling, in the source directory,

g++ -o tetgen *.cxx

Next, to convert a triangular mesh into a tetrahedral mesh, convert the
surface mesh file into a ".off" format file using blender. Following this
run tetgen on the file by calling

tetgen -q<quality value>a<tet volume limit> <file>

I'm not sure exactly what the quality parameter represents other than it's
some ratio concerning edge lengths and angles within a given tetrahedron.
The volume limit is fairly self explanatory. The output from tetgen is a
".node" and a ".elem" pair of files containing the node and element
definitions respectively. An FemModel3d can then be created by TetgenReader
given the paths to the ".node" and ".elem" files created by tetgen.
