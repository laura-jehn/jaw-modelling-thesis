    This document describes how to install and use the Pardiso direct
    sparse solver on Linux, which is used by the ArtiSynth models
    FemModel3d and MechModel. 

Installing Pardiso on Linux

    1. Install Intel MKL 8.1.1 for Linux. 

       This is fairly easy but does take a bit of time. Got to 

http://www.intel.com/cd/software/products/asmo-na/eng/perflib/mkl/index.htm
(or try: http://www3.intel.com/cd/software/products/asmo-na/eng/perflib/mkl/219859.htm)

       and click on "Non-commercial download", then select "Download
       Intel Math Kernel Library ...". A page will appear asking you
       to confirm that the software is for non-commercial purposes and
       that you're OK with not getting support. Then you fill out a
       brief registration form and get an email with download
       instructions and a license key that will be needed to execute
       the install script.

       The default install location is /opt/intel/mkl/8.1.1. Wherever
       you install it, you will need to put the sub-directory lib/32 
       (or lib/64 on a 64 bit machine) in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

    2. Obtain a license and library for Pardiso itself. Go to

http://www.computational.unibas.ch/cs/scicomp/software/pardiso

       and follow the download links. You will have to answer a
       few questions, and then will be emailed a license key
       and a link to the download page itself. 

       The license key consists of a string which should be placed in
       a file called "pardiso.lic" in your home directory. The key
       encodes the host name of the machine, and so each machine you
       run Pardiso one Will require a separate key, which means
       swapping license files around. Yes, this is a pain ...

       The Pardiso library to download is libpardiso_GNU_IA32.so.  You
       can place this anywhere covered by your LD_LIBRARY_PATH; I
       usually put it in my MKL library directory.
