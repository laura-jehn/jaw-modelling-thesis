Movies with sound can now be automatically created. 
In the movie maker dialog, there are the following audio options:

-Record audio: automatically create and merge a wave file with the movie. If this option is selected no audio
will be heard during the recording of the movie.
-Render audio text: Outputs audio seperately as an ASCII file containing float values.
The file will have the same name as the movie, but with a .txt extension
-Normalize audio: normalizes the audio (whether its to a sound or ASCII file).

Currently the temporary audio files are stored in the /tmp directory for debugging purposes, as well as 
format conversion (if desired). If this is no longer deemed necessary, they can be deleted in the future.
