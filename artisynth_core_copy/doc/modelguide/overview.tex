\chapter{ArtiSynth Overview}
\label{Overview:sec}

ArtiSynth is an open-source, Java-based system for creating and
simulating mechanical and biomechanical models, with specific
capabilities for the combined simulation of rigid and deformable
bodies, together with contact and constraints. It is presently
directed at application domains in biomechanics, medicine, physiology,
and dentistry, but it can also be applied to other areas such as
traditional mechanical simulation, ergonomic design, and graphical and
visual effects.

\section{System structure}

An ArtiSynth model is composed of a hierarchy of models and model
components which are implemented by
various Java classes. These may include sub-models (including finite
element models), particles, rigid bodies, springs, connectors, and
constraints.  The component hierarchy may be in turn connected to
various {\it agent} components, such as control panels, controllers
and monitors, and input and output data streams (i.e., {\it probes}),
which have the ability to control and record the simulation as it
advances in time. Agents are presented in more detail in Section
\ref{SimulationControl:sec}. 

The models and agents are collected together within a top-level
component known as a {\it root model}.  Simulation proceeds under the
control of a {\it scheduler}, which advances the models through time
using a physics simulator. A rich graphical user interface (GUI)
allows users to view and edit the model hierarchy, modify component
properties, and edit and temporally arrange the input and output
probes using a {\it timeline} display.

\subsection{Model components}

Every ArtiSynth component is an instance of
\javaclass[artisynth.core.modelbase]{ModelComponent}. When connected
to the hierarchy, it is assigned a unique number relative to its
parent; the parent and number can be obtained using the methods
\javamethod[artisynth.core.modelbase.ModelComponent]{getParent()} and
\javamethod[artisynth.core.modelbase.ModelComponent]{getNumber()},
respectively.  Components may also be assigned a name (using
\javamethod*[artisynth.core.modelbase.ModelComponent]{setName()})
which is then returned using
\javamethod*[artisynth.core.modelbase.ModelComponent]{getName()}.

A sub-interface of {\tt ModelComponent} includes
\javaclass[artisynth.core.modelbase]{CompositeComponent}, which
contains child components.  A
\javaclass[artisynth.core.modelbase]{ComponentList} is a {\tt
CompositeComponent} which simply contains a list of other components
(such as particles, rigid bodies, sub-models, etc.).

Components which contain state information (such as position and
velocity) should extend 
\javaclass[artisynth.core.modelbase]{HasState}, 
which provides the methods
\javamethod*[artisynth.core.modelbase.HasState]{getState()}
and
\javamethod*[artisynth.core.modelbase.HasState]{setState()}
for saving and restoring state.

A
\javaclass[artisynth.core.modelbase]{Model}
is a sub-interface of {\tt CompositeComponent} and {\tt
HasState} that contains the notion of advancing through time and which
implements this with the methods {\tt initialize(t0)} and {\tt
advance(t0, t1, flags)}, as discussed further in
Section \ref{ModelAdvancement:sec}.
The most common instance of {\tt Model} used
in ArtiSynth is {\tt MechModel} (Section \ref{MechModel:sec}), which
is the top-level container for a mechanical or biomechanical model.

\subsection{The RootModel}
\label{RootModel:sec}

The top-level component in the hierarchy is the {\it root model},
which is a subclass of \javaclass[artisynth.core.workspace]{RootModel}
and which contains a list of models along with lists of agents used to
control and interact with these models. The component lists in {\tt
RootModel} include:

\begin{shadedregion}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\tt models & top-level models of the component hierarchy \\
\tt inputProbes & input data streams for controlling the simulation \\
\tt controllers & functions for controlling the simulation \\
\tt monitors & functions for observing the simulation \\
\tt outputProbes & output data streams for observing the simulation \\
\end{tabular}
\end{shadedregion}

Each agent may be associated with a specific top-level model.

\subsection{Component path names}
\label{PathNames:sec}

The names and/or numbers of a component and its ancestors can be used to
form a component path name. This path has a construction 
analogous to Unix file path names, with the '/' character acting as a
separator. Absolute paths start with '/', which indicates the root
model. Relative paths omit the leading '/' and can begin lower down
in the hierarchy. A typical path name might be
\begin{verbatim}
  /models/JawHyoidModel/axialSprings/lad
\end{verbatim}
For nameless components in the path, their numbers can be used
instead.  Numbers can also be used for components that have
names. Hence the path above could also be represented using
only numbers, as in
\begin{verbatim}
  /0/0/1/5
\end{verbatim}
although this would most likely appear only in machine-generated
output.

\subsection{Model advancement}
\label{ModelAdvancement:sec}

ArtiSynth simulation proceeds by advancing all of the root model's
top-level models through a sequence of time steps. Every time
step is achieved by calling each model's 
\javamethod*[artisynth.core.modelbase.Model]{advance()} method:
\begin{lstlisting}[]
  public StepAdjustment advance (double t0, double t1) {
     ... perform simulation ...
  }
\end{lstlisting}
This method advances the model from time {\tt t0} to time {\tt t1},
performing whatever physical simulation is required (see Section
\ref{PhysicsSimulation:sec}). The method may optionally return a {\tt
StepAdjustment} indicating that the step size ({\tt t1} - {\tt t0}) was
too large and that the advance should be redone with a smaller step
size. 

The root model has it's own
\javamethod*[artisynth.core.workspace.RootModel]{advance()}, which in
turn calls the advance method for all of the top-level models, in
sequence. The advance of each model is surrounded by the application
of whatever 
agents are associated with that model. This is done
by calling the agent's {\tt apply()} method:
\begin{lstlisting}[]
   model.preadvance (t0, t1);
   for (each input probe p) {
      p.apply (t1);
   }
   for (each controller c) {
      c.apply (t0, t1);
   }
   model.advance (t0, t1);
   for (each monitor m) {
      m.apply (t0, t1);
   }
   for (each output probe p) {
      p.apply (t1);
   }
\end{lstlisting}
Agents not associated with a specific model are applied before (or
after) the advance of all other models.

More precise details about model advancement are given in the 
\artisynthManual{artisynth}{ArtiSynth Reference Manual}.

\subsection{MechModel}
\label{MechModel:sec}

Most ArtiSynth applications contain a single top-level model which is
an instance of \javaclass[artisynth.core.mechmodels]{MechModel}.  This
is a\pdfbreak
\javaclass[artisynth.core.modelbase]{CompositeComponent} that may
(recursively) contain an arbitrary number of mechanical components,
including finite element models, other {\tt MechModel}s, particles,
rigid bodies, constraints, attachments, and various force effectors.
The {\tt MechModel} {\tt advance()} method invokes a physics simulator
that advances these components forward in time (Section
\ref{PhysicsSimulation:sec}).

For convenience each {\tt MechModel} contains a number of predefined
containers for different component types, including:

%\begin{framed}%
%\colorbox{shadecolor}{%
\begin{shadedregion}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\tt particles & 3 DOF particles \\
\tt points & other 3 DOF points \\
\tt rigidBodies & 6 DOF rigid bodies \\
\tt frames & other 6 DOF frames \\
\tt axialSprings & point-to-point springs \\
\tt connectors & joint-type connectors between bodies \\
\tt constrainers & general constraints \\
\tt forceEffectors & general force-effectors \\
\tt attachments & attachments between dynamic components \\
\tt renderables & renderable components (for visualization only) \\
\end{tabular}
\end{shadedregion}
Each of these is a child component of {\tt MechModel} and is
implemented as a
\javaclass[artisynth.core.modelbase]{ComponentList}. Special methods
are provided for adding and removing items from them. However,
applications are not required to use these containers, and may instead
create any component containment structure that is appropriate.
%(Section \ref{GeneralArrangements:sec}).  
If not used, the containers will simply remain empty.

\section{Physics simulation}
\label{PhysicsSimulation:sec}

Only a brief summary of ArtiSynth physics simulation is described
here.  Full details are given in \cite{lloyd2012artisynth} and in the
related
\href{http://www.artisynth.org/doc/artisynth.pdf}{overview paper}.

For purposes of physics simulation, the components of a {\tt
MechModel} are grouped as follows:

\begin{description}
	
\item[Dynamic components] \mbox{}\hfill\\ Components, such as a
particles and rigid bodies, that contain position and velocity state,
as well as mass. All dynamic components are instances of
the Java interface
\javaclass[artisynth.core.mechmodels]{DynamicComponent}.

\item[Force effectors] \mbox{}\hfill\\
Components, such as springs or finite elements,
that exert forces between dynamic components.
All force effectors are instances of the Java interface
\javaclass[artisynth.core.mechmodels]{ForceEffector}.

\item[Constrainers] \mbox{}\hfill\\
Components that enforce constraints between dynamic components. 
All constrainers are instances of the Java interface
\javaclass[artisynth.core.mechmodels]{Constrainer}.

\item[Attachments] \mbox{}\hfill\\
Attachments between dynamic components. While technically these
are constraints, they are implemented using a different approach.
All attachment components are instances of
\javaclass[artisynth.core.mechmodels]{DynamicAttachment}.

\end{description}

The positions, velocities, and forces associated with all the
dynamic components are denoted by the composite vectors 
$\q$, $\u$, and $\f$. 
In addition, the composite mass matrix is given by
$\M$. 
Newton's second law then gives
\begin{equation}
\f = \frac{d \M \u}{d t} = \M \dot\u + \dot\M \u,
\label{newton:eqn}
\end{equation}
%
where the $\dot\M \u$ accounts for various ``fictitious'' forces.

Each integration step involves solving for
the velocities $\u^{k+1}$ at time step $k+1$ given the velocities and forces
at step $k$. One way to do this is to solve the expression
%
\begin{equation}
\M \, \u^{k+1} = \M \u^k + h \bar\f
\label{velupdate:eqn}
\end{equation}
%
for $\u^{k+1}$, where $h$ is the step size and 
$\bar\f \equiv \f - \dot\M \u$. Given the updated velocities $\u^{k+1}$, one can
determine $\dot\q^{k+1}$ from
%
\begin{equation}
\dot\q^{k+1} = \Q \u^{k+1},
\end{equation}
%
where $\Q$ accounts for situations (like rigid bodies) where $\dot\q \ne
\u$, and then solve for the updated positions using 
%
\begin{equation}
\q^{k+1} = \q^k + h \dot \q^{k+1}.
\label{posupdate:eqn}
\end{equation}
%
(\ref{velupdate:eqn}) and (\ref{posupdate:eqn}) together comprise a
simple {\it symplectic Euler} integrator.

In addition to forces, bilateral and unilateral constraints give rise to
locally linear constraints on $\u$ of the form
%
\begin{equation}
\G(\q) \u = 0, \qquad \N(\q) \u \ge 0.
\label{constraints:eqn}
\end{equation}
%
Bilateral constraints may include rigid body joints, FEM
incompressibility, and point-surface constraints, while unilateral
constraints include contact and joint limits.  Constraints give rise
to constraint forces (in the directions $\G(\q)^T$ and $\N(\q)^T$)
which supplement the forces of (\ref{newton:eqn}) in order to enforce
the constraint conditions.  In addition, for unilateral constraints,
we have a complementarity condition in which $\N \u > 0$ implies no
constraint force, and a constraint force implies $\N \u = 0$.  Any
given constraint usually involves only a few dynamic components and so
$\G$ and $\N$ are generally sparse.

Adding constraints to the velocity solve (\ref{velupdate:eqn})
leads to a mixed linear complementarity problem (MLCP)
of the form
\begin{gather}
\left(
\begin{matrix}
\hat\M^{k} & -\G^{T} & -\N^{T} \\
\G & 0 & 0 \\
\N & 0 & 0 
\end{matrix}
\right)
\left(
\begin{matrix}
\u^{k+1} \\
\tilde\Blam \\
\tilde\Bthe
\end{matrix}
\right)
+
\left(
\begin{matrix}
-\M \u^{k} - h \hat\f^{k} \\
-\g \\
-\n
\end{matrix}
\right)
=
\left(
\begin{matrix}
0 \\
0 \\
\w
\end{matrix}
\right), \notag \\
0 \le \Bthe \perp \w \ge 0,
\label{KKTvelocity:eqn}
\end{gather}
where $\w$ is a slack variable, $\tilde\Blam$ and $\tilde\Bthe$ give the force
constraint impulses over the time step, and $\g$ and $\n$ are
derivative terms defined by
%
\begin{equation}
\g \equiv -h \dot\G \u^k, \quad \n \equiv -h \dot\N \u^k,
\end{equation}
%
to account for time variations in $\G$ and $\N$.
In addition,
$\hat\M$ and $\hat\f$ are $\M$ and $\bar\f$ augmented with stiffness
and damping terms terms to accommodate implicit integration, which
is often required for problems involving deformable bodies.
The actual constraint forces $\Blam$ and $\Bthe$ can be determined
by dividing the impulses by the time step $h$:
%
\begin{equation}
\Blam = \tilde\Blam/h, \quad \Bthe = \tilde\Bthe/h.
\label{impulsesToForces:eqn}
\end{equation}
%

We note here that ArtiSynth uses a {\it full coordinate} formulation,
in which the position of each dynamic body is solved using full, or
unconstrained, coordinates, with constraint relationships acting to
restrict these coordinates. In constract, some other simulation
systems, including OpenSim \cite{delp2007opensim}, use {\it reduced}
coordinates, in which the system dynamics are formulated using a
smaller set of coordinates (such as joint angles) that implicitly take
the system's constraints into account. Each methodology has its own
advantages. Reduced formulations yield systems with fewer degrees of
freedom and no constraint errors. On the other hand, full coordinates
make it easier to combine and connect a wide range of components,
including rigid bodies and FEM models.

Attachments between components can be implemented by constraining the
velocities of the attached components using special constraints of the
form
%
\begin{equation}
\u_j = -\G_{j\alpha} \u_\alpha
\label{attachments:eqn}
\end{equation}
%
where $\u_j$ and $\u_\alpha$ denote the velocities of the attached and
non-attached components. The constraint matrix $\G_{j\alpha}$ is
sparse, with a non-zero block entry for each {\it master} component to
which the attached component is connected. The simplest case involves
attaching a point $j$ to another point $k$, with the simple velocity relationship
%
\begin{equation}
\u_j = \u_k
\end{equation}
%
That means that $\G_{j\alpha}$ has a single entry of $-\I$ (where $\I$
is the $3 \times 3$ identity matrix) in the $k$-th block column.
Another common case involves connecting a point $j$ to
a rigid frame $k$. The velocity relationship for this is
%
\begin{equation}
\u_j = \u_k - \l_j \times \Bom_k
\end{equation}
%
where $\u_k$ and $\Bom_k$ are the translational and rotational
velocity of the frame and $l_j$ is the location of the point relative
to the frame's origin (as seen in world coordinates). The corresponding
$\G_{j\alpha}$ contains a single $3 \times 6$ block entry of the form
%
\begin{equation}
\left(\begin{matrix}
\I & [ l_j ]
\end{matrix}\right)
\end{equation}
%
in the $k-th$ block column, where
%
\begin{equation}
[ l ] \equiv 
\left(\begin{matrix}
0 & -l_z & l_y \\
l_z & 0 & -l_x \\
-l_y & l_x & 0
\end{matrix}\right)
\end{equation}
%
is a skew-symmetric {\it cross product matrix}.
The attachment constraints $\G_{j\alpha}$ 
could be added directly to
(\ref{KKTvelocity:eqn}), but their special form allows us to
explicitly solve for $\u_j$, and hence reduce the size of
(\ref{KKTvelocity:eqn}), by factoring out the attached velocities
before solution.

The MLCP (\ref{KKTvelocity:eqn}) corresponds to a single step
integrator. However, higher order integrators, such as Newmark
methods, usually give rise to MLCPs with an equivalent form.  Most
ArtiSynth integrators use some variation of (\ref{KKTvelocity:eqn}) to
determine the system velocity at each time step.

To set up (\ref{KKTvelocity:eqn}), the {\tt MechModel} component
hierarchy is traversed and the methods of the different component
types are queried for the required values.  Dynamic components (type
{\tt DynamicComponent}) provide $\q$, $\u$, and $\M$; force effectors
({\tt ForceEffector}) determine $\hat\f$ and the stiffness/damping
augmentation used to produce $\hat\M$; constrainers ({\tt
Constrainer}) supply $\G$, $\N$, $\g$ and $\n$, and attachments ({\tt
DynamicAttachment}) provide the information needed to factor out
attached velocities.

\section{Basic packages}

The core code of the ArtiSynth project is divided into three main
packages, each with a number of sub-packages.

\subsection{maspack}

The packages under {\tt maspack} contain general computational
utilities that are independent of ArtiSynth and could be
used in a variety of other contexts. The main packages are:

\begin{lstlisting}[]
maspack.util               // general utilities
maspack.matrix             // matrix and linear algebra
maspack.graph              // graph algorithms
maspack.fileutil           // remote file access 
maspack.properties         // property implementation
maspack.spatialmotion      // 3D spatial motion and dynamics
maspack.solvers            // LCP solvers and linear solver interfaces
maspack.render             // viewer and rendering classes
maspack.geometry           // 3D geometry and meshes
maspack.collision          // collision detection
maspack.widgets            // Java swing widgets for maspack data types 
maspack.apps               // stand-alone programs based only on maspack
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{artisynth.core}

The packages under {\tt artisynth.core} contain the core code for
ArtiSynth model components and its GUI infrastructure.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
artisynth.core.util        // general ArtiSynth utilities
artisynth.core.modelbase   // base classes for model components
artisynth.core.materials   // materials for springs and finite elements
artisynth.core.mechmodels  // basic mechanical models
artisynth.core.femmodels   // finite element models
artisynth.core.probes      // input and output probes
artisynth.core.workspace   // RootModel and associated components
artisynth.core.driver      // start ArtiSynth and drive the simulation
artisynth.core.gui         // graphical interface
artisynth.core.inverse     // inverse tracking controller
artisynth.core.moviemaker  // used for making movies
artisynth.core.renderables // components that are strictly visual
artisynth.core.opensim     // OpenSim model parser (under development)
artisynth.core.mfreemodels // mesh free models (experimental, not supported)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{artisynth.demos}

These packages contain demonstration models that illustrate
ArtiSynth's modeling capabilities:

\begin{lstlisting}[]
artisynth.demos.mech       // mechanical model demos
artisynth.demos.fem        // demos involving finite elements
artisynth.demos.inverse    // demos involving inverse control
artisynth.demos.tutorial   // demos in this manual
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Properties}
\label{Properties:sec}

ArtiSynth components expose {\it properties}, which provide a uniform
interface for accessing their internal parameters and
state. Properties vary from component to component; those for {\tt
RigidBody} include {\tt position}, {\tt orientation}, {\tt mass}, and
{\tt density}, while those for {\tt AxialSpring} include {\tt
restLength} and {\tt material}. Properties are particularly
useful for automatically creating control panels and
probes, as described in Section \ref{SimulationControl:sec}.
They are also used for automating component serialization.

Properties are described only briefly in this section; 
more detailed descriptions are available in the\pdfbreak
\artisynthManual{maspack}{Maspack Reference Manual} and the 
\href{http://www.artisynth.org/doc/artisynth.pdf}{overview paper}.

The set of properties defined for a component is fixed for that
component's class; while property values may vary between component
instances, their definitions are class-specific.  
Properties are exported by a class through code contained in the class
definition, as described in Section \ref{CustomProperties:sec}.

\subsection{Querying and setting property values}
\label{ControllingPropertyValues:sec}

Each property has a unique name that can be used to access its value
interactively in the GUI. This can be done either by using a custom
control panel (Section \ref{ControlPanels:sec}) or by selecting the
component and choosing {\sf Edit properties ...} from the right-click
context menu).

Properties can also be accessed in code using their set/get accessor
methods. Unless otherwise specified, the names for these are formed by
simply prepending {\tt set} or {\tt get} to the property's name.
More specifically, a property with the name {\sf foo} and a value type
of {\tt Bar} will usually have accessor signatures of
%
\begin{lstlisting}[]
  Bar getFoo()

  void setFoo (Bar value)
\end{lstlisting}
%

\subsection{Property handles and paths}
\label{PropertyHandlesAndPaths:sec}

A property's name can also be used to obtain a {\it
property handle} through which its value may be queried or
set generically. Property handles are implemented by
the class \javaclass[maspack.properties]{Property} and are returned by
the component's
\javamethod*[maspack.properties.HasProperties]{getProperty()} method.
{\tt getProperty()} takes a property's name and returns the
corresponding handle. For example, components of type {\tt Muscle}
have a property {\tt excitation}, for which a handle
may be obtained using a code fragment such as
\begin{lstlisting}[]
  Muscle muscle; 
  ...
  Property prop = muscle.getProperty ("excitation");
\end{lstlisting}
Property handles can also be obtained for
sub-components, using a {\it property path} that consists
of a path to the sub-component followed by a colon
`{\tt :}' and the property name. For example,
to obtain the {\tt excitation} property for a sub-component
located by {\tt axialSprings/lad} relative to a {\tt MechModel},
one could use a call of the form
\begin{lstlisting}[]
  MechModel mech;
  ...
  Property prop = mech.getProperty ("axialSprings/lad:excitation");
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Composite and inheritable properties}
\label{CompositeInheritableProperties:sec}

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=3.75in]{images/inheritedProperties}
\end{center}
\caption{Inheritance of a property named {\it stiffness} among
a component hierarchy. Explicit settings are in bold; inherited settings
are in gray italic.}
\label{inheritedProperties:fig}
\end{figure}

Composite properties are possible, in which a property value is a
composite object that in turn has sub-properties. A good example of
this is the {\tt RenderProps} class, which is
associated with the property {\tt renderProps} for renderable objects
and which itself can have a number of sub-properties such as {\tt
visible}, {\tt faceStyle}, {\tt faceColor}, {\tt lineStyle}, {\tt
lineColor}, etc.

Properties can be declared to be {\tt inheritable}, so that their
values can be inherited from the same properties hosted by ancestor
components further up the component hierarchy. Inheritable properties
require a more elaborate declaration and are associated with a {\it
mode} which may be either {\tt Explicit} or {\tt Inherited}.  If a
property's mode is inherited, then its value is obtained from
the closest ancestor exposing the same property whose mode is
explicit. In Figure (\ref{inheritedProperties:fig}), the property {\it
stiffness} is explicitly set in components A, C, and E, and inherited
in B and D (which inherit from A) and F (which inherits from C).

\section{Creating an application model}
\label{CreatingAnApplication:sec}

ArtiSynth applications are created by writing and compiling
an {\it application model} that is a subclass of {\tt RootModel}.
This application-specific root model is then loaded and run by the
ArtiSynth program.

The code for the application model should:

\begin{itemize}

\item Declare a no-args constructor

\item Override the {\tt RootModel}
\javamethod*[artisynth.core.workspace.RootModel]{build()}
method to construct the application.

\end{itemize}

ArtiSynth can load a model either using the build method
or by reading it from a file:

\begin{description}

\item[Build method] \mbox{}

ArtiSynth creates an instance of the
model using the no-args constructor, assigns it a name
(which is either user-specified or the simple name of the class), and
then calls the {\tt build()} method to perform the actual
construction.

\item[Reading from a file] \mbox{}

ArtiSynth creates an instance of the
model using the no-args constructor, and then the model is named
and constructed by reading the file.

\end{description}

The no-args constructor should perform whatever initialization is
required in both cases, while the {\tt build()} method takes the place of the
file specification. Unless a model is originally created using a file
specification (which is very tedious), the first time
creation of a model will almost always entail using the {\tt build()}
method.

The general template for application model code looks like this:

\begin{lstlisting}[]
package artisynth.models.experimental; // package where the model resides
import artisynth.core.workspace.RootModel;
... other imports ...

public class MyModel extends RootModel {

   // no-args constructor
   public MyModel() {
      ... basic initialization ...
   }

   // build method to do model construction
   public void build (String[] args) {
      ... code to build the model ....
   }
}
\end{lstlisting}
Here, the model itself is called {\tt MyModel}, and is defined in the
(hypothetical) 
package {\tt artisynth.models.experimental} (placing models in the super
package {\tt artisynth.models} is common practice but not
necessary).

\begin{sideblock}
Note: The {\tt build()} method was only introduced in ArtiSynth
3.1. Prior to that, application models were constructed using a
constructor taking a {\tt String} argument supplying the name of the
model. This method of model construction still works but is
deprecated.
\end{sideblock}

\subsection{Implementing the build() method}

As mentioned above, the {\tt build()} method is responsible for actual
model construction.  Many applications are built using a single
top-level {\tt MechModel}.  Build methods for these may look
like the following:
\begin{lstlisting}[]
   public void build (String[] args) {
      MechModel mech = new MechModel("mech");
      addModel (mech);

      ... create and add components to the mech model ...
      ... create and add any needed agents to the root model ...

   }
\end{lstlisting}
First, a \javaclass[artisynth.core.mechmodels]{MechModel} is created
(with the name {\tt "mech"} in this example, although any name, or no
name, may be given) and added to the list of models in the root
model. Subsequent code then creates and adds the components required
by the {\tt MechModel}, as described in Sections
\ref{MechModelsI:sec}, \ref{MechModelsII:sec} and \ref{FEMModels:sec}.
The {\tt build()} method also creates and adds to the root model any
agents required by the application (controllers, probes, etc.), as
described in Section \ref{SimulationControl:sec}.

When constructing a model, there is no fixed order in which components
need to be added. For instance, in the above example, {\tt
addModel(mech)} could be called near the end of the {\tt build()}
method rather than at the beginning. The only restriction is that when
a component is added to the hierarchy, all other components that it
refers to should already have been added to the hierarchy. For
instance, an axial spring (Section \ref{ParticlesAndSprings:sec})
refers to two points. When it is added to the hierarchy, those two
points should already be present in the hierarchy.

The {\tt build()} method supplies a {\tt String} array as an argument,
which can be used to transmit application arguments in a manner
analogous to the {\tt args} argument passed to static {\tt main()}
methods. In cases where the model is specified directly on the
ArtiSynth command line (using the {\tt -model <classname>} option), it
is possible to also specify arguments for the {\tt build()} method.
This is done by enclosing the desired
arguments within square brackets {\tt [ ]} immediately following the
{\tt -model} option. So, for example,
%
\begin{verbatim}
> artisynth -model projects.MyModel [ -foo 123 ]
\end{verbatim}
%
would cause the strings {\tt "-foo"} and {\tt "123"} to
be passed to the {\tt build()} method of {\tt MyModel}.

\subsection{Making models visible to ArtiSynth}

In order to load an application model into ArtiSynth, the classes
associated with its implementation must be made visible to ArtiSynth.
This usually involves adding the top-level class directory associated
with the application code to the classpath used by ArtiSynth.

\begin{sideblock}
The demonstration models referred to in this guide belong to the
package {\tt artisynth.demos.tutorial} and are already visible to
ArtiSynth.
\end{sideblock}

In most current ArtiSynth projects, classes are stored in
a directory tree separate from the source code, with the top-level
class directory named {\tt classes}, located one level below
the project root directory. A typical top-level class directory
might be stored in a location like this:
\begin{verbatim}
  /home/joeuser/artisynthProjects/classes
\end{verbatim}
In the example shown in Section \ref{CreatingAnApplication:sec}, the
model was created in the package {\tt artisynth.models.experimental}.
Since Java classes are arranged in a directory structure that mirrors
package names, with respect to the sample project directory shown
above, the model class would be located in
\begin{verbatim}
  /home/joeuser/artisynthProjects/classes/artisynth/models/experimental
\end{verbatim}

At present there are three ways to make top-level class directories
known to ArtiSynth:

\begin{description}

\item[Add projects to your Eclipse launch configuration]\mbox{}

If you are using the Eclipse IDE, then you can add the project in
which are developing your model code to the launch configuration that
you use to run ArtiSynth. Other IDEs will presumably provide similar
functionality.

\item[Add the directories to the EXTCLASSPATH file]\mbox{}

You can explicitly list class directories in the file EXTCLASSPATH,
located in the ArtiSynth root directory (it may be necessary to create
this file).

\item[Add the directories to your CLASSPATH environment variable]\mbox{}

If you are running ArtiSynth from the command line, using the {\tt
artisynth} command (or {\tt artisynth.bat} on Windows), then you can
define a CLASSPATH environment variable in your environment and add
the needed directories to this.

\end{description}

All of these methods are described in more detail in the ``Installing
External Models and Packages'' section of the ArtiSynth Installation
Guide (available for 
\artisynthManual[installation/linuxInstallation]{linuxInstallation}{Linux}, 
\artisynthManual[installation/windowsInstallation]{windowsInstallation}{Windows},
and 
\artisynthManual[installation/macosInstallation]{macosInstallation}{MacOS}).

\subsection{Loading and running a model}
\label{LoadingAndRunning:sec}

If a model's classes are visible to ArtiSynth, then it may be loaded
into ArtiSynth in several ways:

\begin{description}

\item[Loading by class path]\mbox{}

A model may be loaded by directly by choosing {\sf File > Load from
class ...} and directly specifying its class name. It is also possible
to use the {\tt -model <classname>} command line argument to have a
model loaded directly into ArtiSynth when it starts up.

\item[Loading from the Models menu]\mbox{}

A faster way to load a model is by selecting it in one of the {\sf
Models} submenus. This may require editing the model menu
configuration files.

\item[Loading from a file]\mbox{}

If a model has previously been saved to a file, it may be loaded from
that file by choosing {\sf File > Load model ...}.

\end{description}

These methods are described in detail in the 
section ``Loading and Simulating Models'' of the\pdfbreak
\artisynthManual{uiguide}{ArtiSynth User Interface Guide}.

\begin{sideblock}
The demonstration models referred to in this guide should already
be present in the models menu and may be loaded
from the submenu {\sf Models > All demos > tutorial}.
\end{sideblock}

Once a model is loaded, it can be simulated, or {\it run}.
Simulation
of the model can then be started, paused, single-stepped, or reset
using the play controls (Figure \ref{PlayControlsFig})
located at the upper right of the ArtiSynth window frame.
