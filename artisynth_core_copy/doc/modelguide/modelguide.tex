This guide describes how to create mechanical and biomechanical models
in ArtiSynth using its Java API. 

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with basic Java programming,
including variable assignment, control flow, exceptions, functions and
methods, object construction, inheritance, and method overloading.
Some familiarity with the basic I/O classes defined in {\tt
java.io.*}, including input and output streams and the specification
of file paths using {\tt File}, as well as the collection classes
{\tt ArrayList} and {\tt LinkedList} defined in {\tt java.util.*}, is
also assumed.

Section \ref{Overview:sec} offers a general overview of ArtiSynth's
software design, and briefly describes the algorithms used for
physical simulation (Section \ref{PhysicsSimulation:sec}). The latter
section may be skipped on first reading. A more comprehensive
\href{http://www.artisynth.org/doc/artisynth.pdf}{overview paper} is
available online.

The remainder of the manual gives details instructions on how to build
various types of mechanical and biomechanical models.  Sections
\ref{MechModelsI:sec} and \ref{MechModelsII:sec} give detailed
information about building general mechanical models, involving
particles, springs, rigid bodies, joints, constraints, and
contact. Section \ref{SimulationControl:sec} describes how to add
control panels, controllers, and input and output data streams to a
simulation.  Section \ref{FEMModels:sec} describes how to incorporate
finite element models. The required mathematics is reviewed in Section
\ref{MathematicalReview:sec}.

If time permits, the reader will profit from a top-to-bottom read.
However, this may not always be necessary. Many of the sections
contain detailed examples, all of which are available in
the package {\tt artisynth.demos.tutorial} and which may be run from
ArtiSynth using {\sf Models > All demos > tutorials}. 
More experienced readers may wish to find an appropriate example and
then work backwards into the text and preceding sections for any
needed explanatory detail.
