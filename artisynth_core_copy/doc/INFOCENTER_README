This file contains information about the set up of Eclipse InfoCenter
for the ArtiSynth websever.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

An Eclipse InfoCenter can be run as a stand-alone application that
uses the Eclipse help system to provide online documentation through a
web-browser. General information about InfoCenter is available through
the online Eclipse documentation. For example, see

https://help.eclipse.org/mars/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/guide/ua_help_setup_inforcenter.htm

The ArtiSynth websever is currently research.hct.ece.ubc.ca, and
ArtiSynth web materials are currently located under the directory

/var/www/artisynth.org

Location and Contents of the InfoCenter Plugin
----------------------------------------------

The Eclipse distribution that implements InfoCenter is located in 

/var/www/artisynth.org/packages/eclipse-platform-4.4.2

with the plugin that supplies the ArtiSynth documentation contained in

/var/www/artisynth.org/packages/eclipse-platform-4.4.2/plugins/org.artisynth.doc

The plugin directory contains files describing the contents of the
InfoCenter and its initial property settings, along the symbolic links
'javadocs' and 'html', which link to the Java doc and documentation
HTML files located under

/var/www/artisynth.org/artisynth/doc/html
/var/www/artisynth.org/artisynth/doc/javadocs

The contents of the plugin directory are summarized in its README
file. The manuals and guide to be displayed by the InfoCenter are
described in the plugin.xml file, and the order in which they should
appear is described in helpData.xml. The table of contents for each
document is contained in a "xxxToc.xml" file located in the documents
HTML directory. For example, the contents for the Maspack manual are
located in html/maspack/maspackToc.xml. These "Toc.xml" files are
generated automatically when the documentation HTML files are created.

Starting and Restarting the InfoCenter
--------------------------------------

The InfoCenter process can be started, stopped, and restarted using
the scripts startInfoCenter, stopInfoCenter, and restartInfoCenter,
located in /var/www/artisynth.org/bin.

Because of file permission issues, the InfoCenter should be run as the
user www-data. This can be achieved by running the start/stop/restart
scripts using 'su -u www-data'. So for example, to restart the
InfoCenter, one could do

> cd /var/www/artisynth.org
> sudo -u www-data bin/restartInfoCenter

By default, the InfoCenter is started automatically whenever the
ArtiSynth webserver reboots. This is achieved by the following line in
/etc/rc.local:

sudo -u www-data /var/www/artisynth.org/bin/startInfoCenter

It is not always necessary to restart the InfoCenter. The HTML files
that the InfoCenter uses are located under the html directory, and
these can be changed while the InfoCenter is running. The main reasons
for restarting the InfoCenter are

1) when there is a change in the table of contents (i.e., the
"xxxToc.xml" files) for one or more manuals, or

2) when content has changed enough to require the search index
to be rebuilt.

In particular, the search index is cleared inside restartInfoCenter by
simply removing the index directory with the line

rm -rf $ECLIPSE_HOME/configuration/org.eclipse.help.base/index

Connecting the InfoCenter to the Websever
-----------------------------------------

The InfoCenter process runs on port 8081 and is connected to the
Apache webserver for www.artisynth.org by the following entry in
/etc/apache2/sites-available/001-artisynth.conf:

    # routes /manuals to eclipse InfoCenter
    # process running on port 8081
    AddDefaultCharset Off
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass /manuals http://localhost:8081/help
    ProxyPassReverse /manuals http://localhost:8081/help

Adding a New Document
---------------------

When a new manual or guide is added to ArtiSynth, the following steps
should be taken to make the document known to the InfoCenter:

1) Add a <toc> entry for the new document to the plugin.xml file
in the plugin directory.

2) Add another <toc> entry for the document to the helpData.xml
file, telling InfoCenter where the document should appear in the
navigation panel.

3) Add a rewrite rule to /var/www/artisynth.org/doc/.htaccess
redirecting InfoCenter references of the form
https://www.artisynth.org/doc/info/document to
https://www.artisynth.org/manuals/nav/X, where X is the number of the
document in the order given by helpData.xml.

4) Restart the InfoCenter.
