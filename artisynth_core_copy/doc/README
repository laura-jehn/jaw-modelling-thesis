This is the root directory for ArtiSynth and maspack documentation,
which takes the form of javadocs, user and reference manuals, and some
specialized documents.

MUCH OF THIS DOCUMENTATION IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT.

The javadocs are created automatically from the source code, by
running 'make javadocs' in either this directory or the ArtiSynth root
directory.

Most reference and user documentation is created using asciidoc, which
is a lightweight markup language. Sources for various documents are
included in subdirectories as described below.

Some other documents (including some legacy documents) are available
as text and PDF files; these are placed in the directory 'misc'.

Most of this documentation is available online. Go to
www.artisynth.org and navigate to Documentation.
