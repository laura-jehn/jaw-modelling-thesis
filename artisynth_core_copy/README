This is the core distribution of ArtiSynth, a 3D mechanical modeling
system that supports the combined simulation of multibody and finite
element models, together with contact and constraints.  While targeted
at biomechanical and biomedical applications, it can also be used for
general purpose mechanical simulation. It is freely available under a
two-clause BSD-style open source license.

The system is implemented in Java, and provides a rich set of modeling
components, including particles, rigid bodies, finite elements with
both linear and nonlinear materials, point-to-point muscles, and
various bilateral and unilateral constraints including contact. A
graphical interface allows interactive component navigation, model
editing, and simulation control.

Full details, videos and documentation are provided on the ArtiSynth
website at https://www.artisynth.org.

For details on how to install artisynth_core from Github, see the
section "Cloning from Github" in the installation guide appropriate to
your system at https://www.artisynth.org/doc/info/installation.

    System documenation

eclipseSettings.zip
    Default project settings for the Eclipse IDE (obsolete since these
    are now checked directly into the repository)

lib/

    support, mostly involving linear solvers, Java OpenGL (JOGL), and
    collision detection

matlab/
    Matlab scripts for running ArtiSynth from matlab

models.xml
    Alternative format for the Models menu
