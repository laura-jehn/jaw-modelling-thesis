It appears that there is one element on each side of the tongue mesh
that was inverted and simply deleted. The resulting voids correspond
to wedge elements with the nodes:

411 288 412 291 287 293
824 701 825 710 700 706

There is no obvious way of fixing this.  We could divide that space into a bunch
of tets, but they would still be very poorly conditioned.  The other option
is to add new nodes in there to make a bunch of smaller tets. Although, the
surrounding elements also look like they're near inverted, so we may want to
modify those too.
