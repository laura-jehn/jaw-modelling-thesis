This demo  models sound  generation and propagation  in the  vocal tract
(visible  as a  mesh) and  the nasal  tract (not  visible).  The glottal
excitation can  be generated with  a Rosenberg parametric model  or with
the  Ishizaka-Flanagan two-mass model.  The acoustics  of the  vocal and
nasal tracts are modeled  using the linearized discretized Navier-Stokes
equation, which is  integrated in real time and  coupled to the dynamics
of the two-mass model.

Vowel  shapes can  be generated  by  clicking the  preset buttons  which
generate  area functions  for the  six  Russian vowels  as described  in
"Acoustics Theory of Speech Production", Chapter 2.3, Gunnar Fant, 1970.
The default  area function for  the nasal tract  is taken from  Dang and
Honda JASA 96(4) 1994, p2093  fig.6, third subject.  The vocal and nasal
tract shapes can also be changed interactively with the sliders.

Noise is generated at the glottis and at the narrowest part of the vocal
tract  using   the  model  described  in  Sondhi   and  Schroeter,  IEEE
Trans.  Acoust. Speech  and  Signal  Proc, Vol.  ASSP-35,  no. 7,  1987,
pp. 955-967.
    
Various other parameters can be set in the control panels. Note that the
non-linear two-mass model can become unstable.

Explanation of selected GUI elements:

- Main  display:  Vocal  tract   morphed  to  generate  particular  area
functions.

- PlotGraph displays the spectral response of the tract and computes the
  formants. dB (vertical) versus Hz.

- Nasal Tract: 
  * Velum slider closes (0) and opens (1) the velum.
  * M-N Bal sets acoustical energy radiated from Mouth versus Nose.
  * NasalLen is the length of the nasal tract in cm.
  * A(i) are areas in cm^2 at selected points, A(last) at the nose.

- Vocal Tract:
  * Lip M and d are effective Mass and damping of the lip model (piston in
    wall model).
  * Wall damp attenuation coeff. for losses at the wall (for both nasal
    and vocal tract).
  * Length is the length in cm of the tract.
  * A(i) are areas in cm^2 at selected points, A(last) at the mouth.
  * Reset button to recover from instabilities etc.
  * (Un)mute toggles audio on/off.
  * [aoui-ie] Fant Russian vowels. [-] is a neutral position.
  * Formants recomputes the impulse response.
  * ToggleLip model can turn the lipmodel on or off.

- Rosenberg Glottal Model
 * Freq sets the frequency of the excitation.
 * OpenQ is the duty ration (open time versus closed time).
 * Slope determines the slope of the glottal wave.
 * Gain is the acoustic energy. Set to 0 to turn off.

- TwoMass Glottal Model
 * q is a scale factor for masses and spring constants affecting frequency.
 * p-lung is the lung pressure in cm H2O.
 * Ag0 is the rest area of the glottal slit.
 * Below the Save button the glottal volume velocity.

All configurations of the sliders can be saved and loaded.
