# Lists file patterns that should be excluded from the prepackaged
# distribution. Lines beginning with '#' are comments. Distributions
# are created by doing an svn export, and then copying the export
# using tar with the option --exclude-from=DISTRO_EXCLUDE_FILES, where
# DISTRO_EXCLUDE_FILES is this file with the comment lines removed.
